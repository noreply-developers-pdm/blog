Hey there, I am Purvesh. I am a final-year Information Technology student at Government College Of Engineering Aurangabad, India. I love to build things, always love to learn new things about new technologies.


I tend to waste my free time reading news, watching TV shows, playing sports, listening to EDM music, or spend some time coding my small side-projects.
