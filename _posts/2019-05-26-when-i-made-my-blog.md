Well, when I started learning backend technologies by creating medium-like blog platform for professional people, I was keep getting an idea to make my own blog using this so called simple technology known as django.

(Update: Now I have shifted to jekyll a ruby and full markdown based blog with other features.)

While [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a great framework for building web applications, it’s often considered as “too big” for fulfilling simple needs, such as mostly static content. That's where the tools like Jekyll indeed are more lightweight in their default setup and database access is no longer needed, which has a positive effect on the **application loading time**.

The main advantage of this solution is the **simplicity**, you save time and effort on the set up and configuration.
